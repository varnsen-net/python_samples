This repository contains a sample of Python scripts I've written.

# garybot
Garybot is an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) bot with a variety of quality-of-life and entertainment functions.

# ps_maker_crop.py
This script automates the creation of publication-quality figures. The user inputs a list of galaxy IDs, and the script queries a database of Hubble Space Telesacope images, downloads the corresponding data cubes, then outputs a set of images center-cropped on the primary galaxy.

# sf_calculator.py
This simple script uses the Kennicuttâ€“Schmidt law to calculate and plot a galaxy's total star formation rate as a function of time based on that galaxy's initial gas density.

# sig1_sSFR_4panel_plot.py
This script creates a publication-quality plot of high-redshift galaxies with respect to two parameters: star-formation rate, and the mass-density within the galaxy's central kiloparsec. It outputs a plot with four panels, each panel corresponding to one of four redshift bins.
